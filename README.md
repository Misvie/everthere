# Hi Sofi.

Just wanted to let you know that I finished this assignment, took almost 3.5-4hours. 

About my solution :

1.Each notification reason has a notification method, i.e. - notification for a new object has a method called : is_object_new(), all of these methods gets two parameter, new entity and old entity.

2.Every type of object has a list of notification rules - an array of method which should idicate whether a notification should take place.

3.There are test at the method execute() for each notificiation method, each done by different kind of entity.

4.There is a made up entity called "David" which elaborates the idea of adding new entities, for David, I've added a new set of rules, from exitising rules.

5.The method put_input() is the method which was required to implement, it takes and old and new entity, along with entity type string.

This is an initial tryout.

I hope I got the idea of what is need to be done correctly.

This example creates two event with one change, the main() would call a function that creates the two events, add the with type as defined as input, and prints the change.

At first, I thought of using the Observer pattern in order to solve this, but I admit that I never wrote OOD with python, and this is the 1st time I ran into inheritence in Python. 

Please let me know if I'm aiming to the right direction. So far I invested 1.5h on this assignment, should it be a correct way to go, then I will continue that way.

Thanks,

David
