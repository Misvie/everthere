# Hi Sofi

This is an initial tryout.

I hope I got the idea of what is need to be done correctly.

This example creates two event with one change, the main() would call a function that creates the two events, add the with type as defined as input, and prints the change.

At first, I thought of using the Observer pattern in order to solve this, but I admit that I never wrote OOD with python, and this is the 1st time I ran into inheritence in Python. 

Please let me know if I'm aiming to the right direction. So far I invested 1.5h on this assignment, should it be a correct way to go, then I will continue that way.

Thanks,

David
